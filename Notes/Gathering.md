Instead of attacking creatures to weaken and capture them, the main mechanic will be focused around gathering (maybe late game can just capture?)

- areas to gather in
- area with encounter rate determined by item in gathering lure box in center of area
maybe gather in combat for items to use at the collection box?
unsure exactly how want to have player add creatures into ownership

Two primary gathering areas:
- wild
- [[lure zones]]
## [[Lure zones]]

Lure zones are distinct areas where an intractable box is placed in the center.  The player can place items they have gathered.  [[Gathering materials]] will have different drawing effects.

Lure zones are a primary area to acquire new creatures
